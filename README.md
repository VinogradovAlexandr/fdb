Foundation DB client for Elixir

## Status

Under development.

## Implementation Details

As there is no documented stable [wire
protocol](https://forums.foundationdb.org/t/how-difficult-would-it-be-to-implement-the-wire-protocol-in-other-languages/69)
the only practical option is to use the [C
API](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/api-c.html). NIF has some
major [downsides](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html#WARNING)

* pre-emptive scheduling

The Foundation DB C API uses event loop architecture. Nearly all the
API functions are non blocking â€” blocking API functions are not used
by FDB. The event loop runs on a seperate thread and the communication
is done via callback functions. The callback function when invoked
will send a message to Process. This architecture makes sure the NIF
functions return immediatly and gives the control back to VM

* memory protection

This mostly comes down to careful coding. Currenly I am running the
tests under valgrind locally. With some effort it could be integrated
in travis. FDB also runs the [bindings
tester](https://forums.foundationdb.org/t/creating-new-bindings/207)
(used to test other language bindings) in travis CI.

* concurrency

The Foundation DB C API functions are thread safe except for the
network intialization part. NIF implementation tries to avoid
concurrency problems by not mutating the values once created.

It's still possible that there are a bugs in C API or the NIF
implementation, which could lead to VM crash.
